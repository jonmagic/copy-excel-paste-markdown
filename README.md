# Copy Excel Paste Markdown

Copy a table in Excel (or other spreadsheet programs) and paste it as a Markdown table.

You can simply clone the repo and then point your browser to the cloned `index.html`.

# Added features for Restructured text

Another simple markup language is ![RestructuredText](http://www.google.com).

It has three options for creating table.

- List tables. These are ideal for tables where you want to fold the text. 
- Simple tables. This is a bit of a misnomer: these are most like markdown tables
- Multicell or grid tables. These are similar to markdown as well.

![Here](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html) you can find more information.

The `index.html` now contains three extra text areas for the three table variants that exist in reST.
